# Contributing to ICTServe

Thank you for your interest in contributing to ICTServe! This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributing to the project.

## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to abide by our code of conduct:

- Use welcoming and inclusive language
- Be respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accept constructive criticism
- Focus on what is best for the community
- Show empathy towards other community members

## Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy

We use a GitFlow-inspired branching strategy:

- `main` - Production-ready code
- `develop` - Integration branch for features
- `feature/*` - Feature development branches
- `bugfix/*` - Bug fix branches
- `hotfix/*` - Critical production fixes

### Branch Naming Convention

- **Features**: `feature/<issue-id>-short-description`
  - Example: `feature/123-user-authentication`
- **Bug fixes**: `bugfix/<issue-id>-fix-name`
  - Example: `bugfix/456-login-validation-error`
- **Hotfixes**: `hotfix/<issue-id>-urgent-fix`
  - Example: `hotfix/789-security-patch`

### Commit Message Format

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

#### Types

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

#### Examples

```
feat: add user registration functionality

fix: resolve database connection timeout issue

docs: update installation instructions

test: add unit tests for user model
```

## Pull Request Process

1. **Create a feature branch** from `develop`

   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   git checkout -b feature/123-your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following our coding standards

3. **Write tests** for your changes

   ```bash
   php artisan test
   ```

4. **Update documentation** if necessary

5. **Commit your changes** using conventional commit format

   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add new feature description"
   ```

6. **Push to your branch**

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/123-your-feature-name
   ```

7. **Create a Pull Request** to `develop` branch

### Pull Request Requirements

- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Code follows PSR-12 coding standards
- [ ] Documentation is updated if necessary
- [ ] At least one reviewer approval
- [ ] All CI checks pass
- [ ] No merge conflicts

## Coding Standards

### PHP

We follow PSR-12 coding standards. Use Laravel Pint for automatic formatting:

```bash
./vendor/bin/pint
```

### Database

- Use descriptive migration names
- Always provide rollback functionality
- Use proper foreign key constraints
- Add indexes for frequently queried columns

### Testing

- Write feature tests for user-facing functionality
- Write unit tests for complex business logic
- Maintain test coverage above 80%
- Use meaningful test names that describe the scenario

```php
public function test_user_can_create_loan_application(): void
{
    // Test implementation
}
```

### Frontend

- Use semantic HTML elements
- Ensure accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Add proper ARIA labels where needed
- Test with keyboard navigation

   ```

6. **Run migrations**

   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   ```

7. **Build assets**
