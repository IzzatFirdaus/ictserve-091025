## 3 Optional Improvements (Low Priority) ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Improvement #1: Service Card Badge Positioning
**Time:** 15 minutes  
**Priority:** LOW  
**Impact:** Visual consistency only

**What Screenshot Shows:**
Status badges ("Available", "Urgent", "24/7") in **top-right corner of gradient header**.

**Current Code:**
Badges are in card body section.

**Quick Fix:**
```blade
<!-- Move badge to gradient header -->
<div class="relative h-48 bg-gradient-to-br from-blue-500 to-blue-600">
    <div class="absolute top-4 right-4 z-10">
        <span class="badge-success">Available</span>
    </div>
    <!-- Rest of header content -->
</div>
```

---

### Improvement #2: Footer Logo Height Consistency
**Time:** 5 minutes  
**Priority:** LOW  
**Impact:** Visual consistency

**Issue:**
- First two logos: `h-16` (64px)
- Third logo: `h-12` (48px)
- CSS class defines `h-12` but gets overridden

**Quick Fix:**
```blade
<!-- Remove inline heights, let CSS handle it -->
<img src="..." class="footer-logo" width="48" height="48">
<!-- (applies to all 3 logos) -->
```

---

### Improvement #3: Mobile Menu Focus Trap
**Time:** 30 minutes  
**Priority:** LOW  
**Impact:** Accessibility enhancement

**What's Missing:**
Focus trap to prevent keyboard users tabbing outside menu when open.

**Quick Fix:**
Add focus trap utility in `resources/js/app.js` (code provided in full report).
